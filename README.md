After launching the application, you will be facing the home activity with two options : Either *Scan a flashcode* or *See my museums*.

<h2>Scan</h2>

By clicking on 'Scan' an permission pop-up will ask if you agree for the application to access the camera. You should accept in order to continue.
Once your camera screen appears you are now able to point a flashcode in order to get a museum informations.

A valid flashcode is made of the target museum id. As an exemple the flashcode made of the text "3" will point out the third museum of the database once scanned.

The scan redirects on a museum page where all the museum informations are displayed (name, address, image and closing dates) and where you are able to
take a picture by clicking on the "take a picture" button which will upload your picture of the museum online.

Each scanned museum will be saved locally in a database that is accessible threw the "See my museums" option.

<h2>See my museums</h2>

By clicking on 'See my museums' the application will redirect you on a list where every scanned museum is visible, making possible to see their informations again.

By clicking on one of the museums you will be redirected on the same museum page the one after scanning and you be able to
take a picture by clicking on the "take a picture" button which will upload your picture of the museum online.

<h2>Take a picture option</h2>

As said before, a "take a picture" option is available on the museum pages permitting you to upload your own picture of the building. You shoukd know that this option will
make the uploaded photo visible by all the other users of the API and that the authorized photos must have a maximum size of 1Mb.
